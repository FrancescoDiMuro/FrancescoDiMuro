- 👋 Hi, I’m @FrancescoDiMuro, and I currently work as software developer (mainly SCADA) for a company.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning programming skills, especially in managing data and RDBMS, other than make little scripts to simplify everyday tasks.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python projects in data science (with Numpy & | Pandas), in order to make some experience.
- 📫 How to reach me: text me on here 😊
